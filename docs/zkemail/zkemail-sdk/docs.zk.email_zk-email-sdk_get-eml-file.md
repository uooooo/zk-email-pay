Before you can create a blueprint, you need to get an .EML file. This file contains an email message in the format of the [RFC 5322](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322.html) standard and in the registry is used to test the [decomposed regex](https://docs.zk.email/zk-email-sdk/regex#decomposed-regex) and auto-extract the email sender, header length, and body length.

## What is an .EML File? [‚Äã](https://docs.zk.email/zk-email-sdk/get-eml-file\#what-is-an-eml-file "Direct link to What is an .EML File?")

An .EML file is a standard format for storing email messages. It contains all the components of an email, including headers, body text, and attachments. This format is widely supported and can be opened by most email clients and text editors.

## Proton Mail [‚Äã](https://docs.zk.email/zk-email-sdk/get-eml-file\#proton-mail "Direct link to Proton Mail")

Note that currently, Protonmail's desire for non-repudiation means that users are not empowered with enough cryptographic data from the email in order to verify DKIM themselves. We do not agree with the design, as we think users should be in control of their own cryptographic verification as much as possible, with an option to delete that data if they so choose. That means that currently, Protonmail users cannot use the [registry](https://docs.zk.email/zk-email-sdk/registry) to prove emails they received, but they can send still emails to trigger on chain transactions (i.e. they can still use account recovery or email wallet).

1. Open the specific email you wish to export.
2. Click the three dots (More options) icon in the top-left corner of the email.
3. Select "Export" from the dropdown menu.
4. The email will automatically save as an .eml file.
